# cellular automata for world map generation

## premise
I have been interested in procedural generation of maps for a long time, and was inspired by loren schmidt's recent work to pick up this kind of thing again. You should go check out her patreon, there's a lot of cool stuff on there!



## usage
I mean, if you made a local copy to play with it you can just run a local server (like with VSCode's live server or whatever)... I might eventually add interface to the website to make it interactive but right now you have to just fiddle with the rules in the code by hand.
